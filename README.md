# Jank & Pong!

Hi.

I'll be making the rock paper scissors game in JS, but not GUI yet. This project is a part of the TOP curriculum. After finishing this game, I'll be proficient in JS hopefully.

21:53 2025/04/06: Hey I've added an UI to this project. You can access it at [Jank & Pong!](https://huangphoux.github.io/odin-jankenpon/).

Todo list (I'll do it, eventually):

-   Center the page
-   Add some colours
-   Add +1 when updating score
